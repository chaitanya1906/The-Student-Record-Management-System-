# The-Student-Record-Management-System-
Python  app (SRMS) to automate manual student grading and record keeping. It uses basic procedural structures: sequential if/elif for grade calculation and a manual while loop for search. Data is held in a global list/dict structure. Intentionally coded to be procedural and human-generated for course integrity.
